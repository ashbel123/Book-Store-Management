A simple website that has crud operations.
As It is mentioned as simple website. It has no login/signup, this website focused on admin that manages the book-store.
## Admin can 
   - add the books in the store.
   - Delete books in the store that are no longer published and available (or) out of stock.
   - Edit the information if it is wrong.
   - Had an option to select books to a separate page called MyBooks. (may be like a list)
     (A facility given by Admin who wants to read specific books or he can keep the list for checking them with the publisher. about the selling and all).

This project was made to gain hand-On experience in crud operations throught SpringBoot, and learning the internal working of it.
